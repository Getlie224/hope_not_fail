# University Timetable Web Application

## Mini Project of Abbos Shodiyev

This project is a Flask-based web application that dynamically displays the timetable for university courses based on the student's level. The project connects to a PostgreSQL database, and the courses are filtered according to the student's level. 

The web application allows students to:
- View their personalized timetable based on their level.
- Interact with a PostgreSQL database containing real course data.
- See the courses listed by their names, times, and other relevant details.

### Features:
- **Database Integration**: Real courses from Webster University's timetable have been inserted into the PostgreSQL database.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Students can view courses based on their level (e.g., Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior).
- **Personalized HTML**: The web page header includes the student's name (e.g., "Mini project of Abbos Shodiyev").
- **Dockerization**: The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across environments.
  
### Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: Python web framework to build the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing course information.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **HTML**: For creating the web page layout.

### Setup and Installation:
